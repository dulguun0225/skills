# Skill redundancy audit, 2026-08-11 — do these skills override anything?

**Ported 2026-09-16 from the abandoned `../asdlc` monorepo**, where these skills
lived from 2026-08-05 until the port ([asdlc-port](asdlc-port.md)). The record
below is that repository's `reference/research/2026-08-11-skill-redundancy-audit.md`
with paths rewritten to this layout and its links into that repository's
decision records replaced by plain text; **nothing in the findings was changed.**
The runner and the cases are `scripts/redundancy-probes.mjs` and
`scripts/redundancy-cases.json`, run as `npm run probes`. The "4 `asdlc-*`
stage skills" it excludes were that repository's own lifecycle procedures and
never lived here. Its first addendum reasons from that repository's agent
roster — a `coder` agent on sonnet, a `deep-worker` on the session model —
which is why the second probe batch ran at sonnet / effort high; that roster
does not exist here, and the tier finding stands on its own.

---


Date: 2026-08-11. Status: complete; **trim executed 2026-08-12** (see the second addendum). Models measured: `claude-sonnet-5` and `claude-opus-5`, CLI 2.1.227, linux. Probe spend: $29.34 (64 sessions) + $3.42 (24 bucket-B sessions, 2026-08-12).

**Result in one line:** no skill is deletable — 11 of 16 probed directives were violated by a bare agent (5 of them on the frontier tier too) — but 5 probed directives and ~25 desk-classified pro-default directives are trim candidates, and compliance is strongly tier-dependent: bare sonnet passed 13/32 sessions, bare opus 26/32, so every redundancy claim weakens one model tier down.

## The question

The 20 engineering-decision skills exist to override training-data defaults ([README.md](../../README.md) "Why this exists"). The owner's criterion for this audit: **if a bare agent already performs the task correctly from training data alone, the skill (or directive) does not need to exist.** This note classifies every load-bearing directive, probes the contested classifications empirically, and gives a keep/trim/merge/delete verdict per skill.

The 4 `asdlc-*` stage skills are out of scope: they are lifecycle procedure, not training-data override.

## Method

**Per-directive classes:**

| class | meaning | consequence |
|---|---|---|
| contra-default | the bare model's default differs from the directive | binding — the skill's reason to exist |
| pro-default | a bare 2026 Claude agent already complies unprompted | redundant directive — trim candidate |
| dated-fact | version pin, licence branch, digest, dated benchmark, dated negative search | not derivable from weights — keep by construction |
| contested | contra-default claimed, bare compliance plausible either way | probed empirically where the verdict hinges on it |

**Stage A (desk triage):** seven parallel agent passes, one per skill group, each reading every `SKILL.md` and companion file in full, classifying each directive with the calibration: corpus-common good practice leans pro-default or contested regardless of what the skill asserts; review-substituting restraint (fail-loud, refusing the convenient shortcut) leans contra-default because helpfulness training biases toward task completion; anything dated is dated-fact. Desk triage is the model grading its own knowledge — a plausible-but-unverified verdict by construction — so no contested claim was settled at the desk.

**Stage B (probes):** 16 probe cases (`scripts/redundancy-cases.json`), selected from 74 proposed by the triage passes on one criterion: the probe must be able to change a verdict (a trim decision, or a flagship corpus-default claim an entire skill family rests on). Runner: `scripts/redundancy-probes.mjs` — headless `claude -p` sessions with **no skills installed**, isolated `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, tools Read/Glob/Grep/Write/Edit only (deny-list + outcome assertion per the firing harness's 2026-08-03 lesson; the assertion caught `Monitor` on this run's first batch — five sessions voided and re-run), 16-turn cap, prompt never hints at the directive. Two repeats per case per tier. Grading is manual against each case's written criterion, from the session's written files and final text.

**Two model tiers** (owner decision, 2026-08-11): `claude-sonnet-5` and `claude-opus-5`, both CLI 2.1.227, linux, 2026-08-11. "Redundant" requires compliance on **both** tiers — the deployed fleet may not run the frontier model. A verdict here is a measurement of these two models on this date; re-check on deployment-model change, not on calendar.

**What a probe result means:** any violation in any session confirms the directive binds (the skill earns its place on that row). Compliance in all sessions on both tiers (4 sessions) marks the directive pro-default *at N=2 per tier* — evidence for trimming, not proof; firing-harness rule applies: a single session is a coin flip.

## Stage A — per-skill classification

Notation: directive ids as the skills carry them (`M-n`, `C-n`, `E-n`) or as assigned by the triage pass (`D-n`, `R-n`, `A-n`, `O-n`, `B-n`, `G-n`, `P-n`, `N-n`, `T-n`, `J-n`, `E-nn` per group table). Full per-directive tables with one-line reasons are in the triage transcripts; this section carries every id and its class.

### Async-handoff group

**async-handoff** — contra-default: E-1–E-4, E-6, E-7, E-9, E-11, E-12, E-14, E-17–E-20, E-23–E-26, E-28, D1 (no owner ⇒ synchronous), D2 (interlocks).

Dated-fact grounding throughout (Kafka/RabbitMQ/SQS behavior table, 2026-07-29), several entries **anti-corpus** — model memory asserts them wrongly.

**async-handoff-shapes** — contra-default: E-30 (compensation tolerates absent forward effect), E-31 (timer destination ≠ retry destination), E-36 (claim check; SQS 256 KB→1 MiB correction is anti-corpus dated-fact). Contested: E-29 (irreversible step last), E-34 (outbound webhook defences — probed), E-35 (inbound webhook shape).

**async-handoff-java** — dated-fact nearly pure: D1–D4 (broker/licence/billing/outbox-library picks, 2026-07-29), E-2j–E-36j (meta-annotation `@Target`, `FutureReturnValueIgnored`, BATCH mode, `FixedBackOff(0,9)`, `@RetryableTopic` ordering loss, AsyncAPI comparator false-green, Toxiproxy semantics, JDK address predicates, LocalStack auth), D8 (static-analysis absence sweep). Contra-default: D5–D7 (owner prerequisite, 16-step wiring + deferral record, signing-standard record). Redundant with training data: none found.

### Stack / toolchain group

**backend-stack** — contra-default: B1, B2, B4 (corpus gravity as a cost — the inversion no bare agent makes), B5, B8, B10. Pro-default: B3, B6, B7. Dated-fact: B9 (worked case, 2026-06-12, own do-not-cite list).

**guardrails-toolchain** — contra-default: G1's advisory-uncovered discipline, G2, G4's gate-adoption half, G5, G7, G9, G10, G12, G13, G14, G15. Pro-default: G1 core, G6, G8, G11, G16 core — **roughly a third of directive tokens restate 2026 CI common sense**. Dated-fact: G3's GHAS boundary, G16's schedule window (both 2026-06-13, no primary source — the skill's own known weakness).

**primary-keys** — contra-default: P1 (rank by surfaces), P2's anti-hybrid half, P3's checklist-length criterion, P4, P6 (ORDER BY ban — direct inversion of v7's advertised benefit; probed), P9's ban-by-name, P10's golden layout test, P11, P16. Pro-default: P7, P8, P13, P14, P15 core, P2's don't-expose half, P5's folklore facts — **over half the directive text**. Dated-fact: P5's benchmark numbers (2026-06-12, unreproduced), P17.

Dated-fact: N7's negative statutory search (one jurisdiction, one date, explicitly not "none exists").

### Java stack group

**java-backend-rules** — contra-default: R2 (jOOQ over JPA), R4, R7, R16, R19, R24–R26 (the annotation bans — corpus defaults by the skill's own naming), R28, R30's gate half. Contested: R3, R5, R6, R11, R13–R15, R20 (Clock — probed), R21, R22, R29. Pro-default: R1, R8, R10, R23, R27 — a few lines, not the skill. Dated-fact: R9 (squawk hazards 2026-07-25), R12 (panel-refuted wording 2026-07-24), R17 (preview-API version facts), R18, R30's JaCoCo pin.

**java-backend-api** — contra-default: A1 (committed OpenAPI vs springdoc runtime serving), A2, A3, A4, A7, A8, A9–A12 (keyset only, 400-not-clamp overriding Spring's own default and AIP-158, sealed cursors), A17, A19 (PATCH ban), A20, A21, A22. Contested: A5, A6 (problem+json, no internals on wire — probed), A13. Pro-default: A15, A16, A18. Dated-fact: A2's springdoc issues, A9's jOOQ 3.20 target list, A14, A20's oasdiff behavior.

**java-backend-observability** — contra-default: O1 (javaagent ban vs vendor's own recommendation), O2, O4 (typed facade vs raw SLF4J — plausibly the largest real delta in the whole set), O5, O6, O7 (visible wrappers vs MDC filter), O8, O13 (fire-tested alerts vs near-universal practice), O15. Contested: O3, O10, O11, O12. Pro-default: O14. Dated-fact: O9 (backend MDC-inheritance matrix, panel 2026-07-27), O5's tool split, O10's ScopedValue caveats.

### Traps / principles group

**llm-default-traps** — dated-fact: T5 (jqwik ≤ 1.9.3, the 1.10.x incident), T6's fork-status ground (probed anyway — cheap), all `confirmed`/`review-by 2027-01-24` dates, the Trivy-compromised-twice record. Contra-default/contested: T1a (registry check), T1b, T2 (injection surface + ceiling-pin response), T3 (SHA-pin), T4 (legal deadline local time), T7 (Error Prone not ArchUnit for non-loggability), T8 (JSR-385/Indriya — probed), T9 (char[] myth). Pro-default: T1c (lockfiles).

**ai-maintainer-principles** — contra-default: A1 (three-branch magic discriminator), A2 (design out whole-program reasoning — the skill's own draft produced the banned move), A4 (module per session), A8 (fresh-context review substitute). Contested: A5 (wills vs services), A7 (gate relaxation under owner pressure), A9 (predecessor as inventory — contradicts golden-master orthodoxy), A10 (zero retries — probed), A12 (subtle piece gate). Pro-default: A3 (committed operational state — GitOps mainstream), A6 core (formatter), A11 (the skill itself concedes "ordinary engineering"). Trim candidates: A3, A11's non-ladder half.

## Stage B — probe results

Cases and grading criteria: `scripts/redundancy-cases.json`. 32/32 clean sessions per tier (sonnet: 5 `Monitor`-voided and 2 rate-limited sessions re-run). PASS = the bare agent complied with the directive unprompted; one FAIL anywhere = the directive binds.

| probe | directive | sonnet | opus | conclusion |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P6-orderby-uuidv7 | primary-keys P6: no ORDER BY id | 0/2 | 0/2 | **binds, both tiers** — 4/4 gave the exact banned answer; one opus session argued the pool is irrelevant |
| M1-reject-vs-round | money M-1: reject excess precision | 0/2 | 0/2 | **binds, both tiers** — convergent bare default is "preserve every digit, round explicitly later"; one opus test pinned the opposite of the directive |
| A10-flaky-retry | ai-maintainer A10: zero retries | 0/2 | 1/2 | **binds, both tiers** — sonnet added `rerunFailingTestsCount=2` twice; one opus session put retry inside the blocking gate despite building a quarantine register |
| P5-id-design | primary-keys P2: reject the hybrid | 0/2 | 1/2 | **binds** — hybrid is the strong bare default; all sessions independently satisfied the enumerability sub-clause (that half is pro-default) |
| G4-review-closure | guardrails G4: finding → deterministic gate | 1/2 | 2/2 | binds, marginally — the sole FAIL kept the LLM reviewer as the regression gate |
| N13-check-digit | business-numbering N13: Damm not Luhn | 1/2 | 2/2 | binds at sonnet — one session cited the 09↔90 gap and picked Luhn anyway |
| T6-jollyday | traps T6: focus-shift fork | 1/2 | 2/2 | binds at sonnet — flips between fork and dead `de.jollyday` across repeats |
| E5-outbox | async E-5: outbox, no publish-in-path | 0/2 | 2/2 | binds at sonnet — both sonnet sessions wrote `@TransactionalEventListener(AFTER_COMMIT)` + `send()`, the named FAIL pattern verbatim; opus built the outbox unprompted |
| E34-webhook-out | shapes E-34: SSRF defences | 0/2 | 2/2 | binds at sonnet — one sonnet session shipped zero SSRF defence; the other got 4/5 clauses, missing resolve-then-connect |
| M5-batch-failloud | money M-5: fail loud under pressure | 0/2 | 2/2 | binds at sonnet — catch-log-skip with the total posted anyway; opus refused to post silent partials |
| A56-error-shape | api A5/A6: RFC 9457 via one advice | 0/2 | 2/2 | binds at sonnet — ad-hoc error records (bodies clean, shape wrong) |
| G15-baseline-ban | guardrails G15: no plain baseline | 2/2 | 2/2 | **pro-default at N=2** — all four independently derived the skill's own ground and imposed ratchet/expiry |
| C-D1-cache-pressure | caching D1/C-2: don't reach for a cache | 2/2 | 2/2 | **pro-default at N=2 in this shape** — 4/4 fixed the N+1 and index, zero caches; note the fixture had an obvious root cause, so this refutes "cache is the first answer" only where a visible fix exists |
| M8-allocation | money M-8: allocation conserves | 2/2 | 2/2 | **pro-default at N=2** — integer cents + remainder distribution, conservation-tested, every session |
| R20-clock | rules R20: injected Clock | 2/2 | 2/2 | **pro-default at N=2** — every session injected Clock and tested on a fixed clock |
| T8-units | traps T8: Indriya not JSR-275 | 2/2 | 2/2 | **pro-default at N=2** — no JSR-275/JScience appeared anywhere |

Totals: bare sonnet 13/32 PASS, bare opus 26/32 PASS. Every case that binds at only one tier binds at the cheaper one.

## Verdicts

Delete: **none.** Trim verdicts name directives; per-firing token yield of a trim is measurable with `npm run tokens` before executing it.

| skill | verdict | grounds |
|---|---|---|
| tech-decision-research | keep | core method uniformly contra-default; owns the confidence-marker vocabulary |
| enforceable-rules | keep | five incompleteness checks + both marker vocabularies load-bearing for the whole set |
| money | keep, trim M-3, M-4; demote M-8 | M-1 confirmed binding 0/4; M-5 confirmed at sonnet; M-8 pro-default at N=2, M-3/M-4 desk pro-default. **Executed 2026-08-12, +71 tokens** — demotion records outweigh the two-line cut |
| money-api | keep | M-17/M-18 contra core; M-14 dated; A56-adjacent probe confirms wire-shape discipline binds at sonnet |
| money-storage | keep, trim M-33; **M-31 trim cancelled** | reject-over-round class confirmed by M1 probe; five engine facts dated. 2026-08-12 probe: M-31 **binds 0/2** at sonnet (bare default is `bigint` minor units), M-33 pro-default 2/2. **Executed 2026-08-12, +96 tokens** — M-31's binding evidence recorded |
| money-java | keep | almost pure dated-fact (pitest pin, Schemathesis keys, jOOQ facts); J4 one-line trim at most. **Executed 2026-08-12, −5 tokens** |
| caching | keep | C-2/C-4/C-7/C-9/C-13–C-15 contra-default; D1's "first answer is a cache" weakened by probe — reword, don't delete (probe shape had a visible root cause). **Reword executed 2026-08-12, +84 tokens** — the probe-scoped ground is an addition by design |
| caching-java | keep | dated-fact dense (licence boundary, tool limits, pricing); nothing redundant found |
| async-handoff | keep | E-5 confirmed binding at sonnet (the exact named FAIL pattern); catalog/seam machinery anti-corpus |
| async-handoff-shapes | keep | E-34 confirmed binding at sonnet; E-30/E-31 contra-default; planned trim of E-34/E-35 cancelled by probe |
| async-handoff-java | keep | nearly pure dated-fact, several anti-corpus (model memory asserts them wrongly) |
| backend-stack | keep | B1/B2/B4 ranking logic non-corpus; pro-default rows cheap |
| guardrails-toolchain | **trim** | ~⅓ of directive tokens restate 2026 CI common sense (G1 core, G6, G8, G11, G16 core); G15 pro-default at N=2; G4/G10/G12/G13/G14 + advisory-uncovered discipline stay. **Executed 2026-08-12, −137 tokens** (G16 mapping caveat in the second addendum) |
| primary-keys | **trim** | P7/P8/P13/P14/P15-core pro-default (>half the text); core confirmed binding hard (P6 0/4, hybrid rejection) — trim the cliché, keep the inversions. 2026-08-12 probes: all five pro-default at sonnet; P8's renumbering ban binds (rotatable-number proposal). **Executed 2026-08-12, −38 tokens** — checks, layer clauses and ownership paragraphs are most of those sections and stay |
| business-numbering | keep | N13 confirmed at sonnet; counter-transaction design + recorded predecessor defects non-corpus |
| java-backend-rules | keep, trim R1, R8, R10, R23, R27; demote R20 | annotation bans + jOOQ core contra-default; R20 pro-default at N=2. 2026-08-12 probes: all five pro-default at sonnet. **Executed 2026-08-12, +196 tokens** — the five rows were already one-liners, so demotion is pure addition |
| java-backend-api | keep, trim A15, A16, A18 | A5/A6 confirmed binding at sonnet; A1/A9/A11/A19 override framework defaults by name. 2026-08-12 probes: all three pro-default at sonnet. **Executed 2026-08-12, +43 tokens** — already terse; stamped, not cut |
| java-backend-observability | keep, trim O14 | O4/O1/O13/O7 plausibly the largest real deltas in the set; O9 matrix dated panel work. **Executed 2026-08-12, +18 tokens** — phrase-ownership note kept |
| llm-default-traps | keep; demote T8 to one line | T5 jqwik pin owns three siblings; T6 confirmed at sonnet; T8 pro-default at N=2 — per the skill's own growth path, a passing trap demotes rather than deletes. **Executed 2026-08-12, +39 tokens** |
| ai-maintainer-principles | keep, trim A3, A11's non-ladder half | A10 confirmed binding on both tiers; A2/A8 review-substituting core. **Executed 2026-08-12, −83 tokens** |

**The tier finding, stated for the record:** whether a skill is redundant is a property of the *deployed* model, not of the skill. On these probes the frontier tier already does unprompted what the cheaper tier does not (outbox, SSRF defences, RFC 9457, fail-loud batch). Any decision to trim on frontier-tier evidence silently breaks the moment a cheaper model joins the fleet — and the fleet model for this design is an open rollout parameter.

## Do not reintroduce

Behavioral claims refuted at N=2 per tier on `claude-sonnet-5` + `claude-opus-5`, 2026-08-11. Scope: these two models, these probe shapes; not licences to delete the directive — grounds to stop citing the claim as self-evident.

- "A bare agent's first answer to a slow endpoint is a cache" — refuted where the fixture shows a findable root cause: 4/4 fixed the N+1 and the missing index, zero caches added (C-D1). The claim may still hold with no visible fix; that shape was not probed.
- "Bare agents round allocation shares independently and drift cents" — refuted: 4/4 used integer cents + remainder distribution with a conservation test (M8).
- "Bare agents write wall-clock reads in domain code" — refuted: 4/4 injected `Clock` and tested on a fixed clock, unprompted (R20).
- "Bare agents adopt the plain findings baseline" — refuted: 4/4 refused it and independently derived the never-shrinks ground (G15).
- "JSR-275/JScience outnumbering Indriya in the corpus makes bare agents pick the dead API" — refuted behaviorally: 4/4 picked unit-api + Indriya (T8).

## Addendum 2026-08-12 — verdicts re-read against the known consumer map

The agents family joined this repository (that repository's ADR-0047)
with a fixed routing table, so the tier that executes each skill is no longer hypothetical:

- `coder` — **sonnet / medium**, carries the `Skill` tool: the default writer for well-scoped
  code, including everything that does not announce itself as a correctness-critical domain.
  The recorded end-to-end stage run (2026-08-11) implemented via a coder subagent, so the
  pilot's implementation tier is sonnet/medium — the tier that passed 13/32 probe sessions.
- `deep-worker` — inherits the session model (frontier on this bench): the named domain
  classes (money, async handoff, caching, API error contracts, webhook delivery, batch
  failure policy, dependency picks) route here by description match. Routing is stochastic
  matching, not a gate — incidental contact with these domains still lands on `coder`.
- `scout`/`prober` — haiku, never write code, never load skills: no haiku exposure exists, so
  the two-tier bar needs no third tier. Tripwire: routing code work to haiku voids every
  verdict here.
- Toolchain/architecture skills (backend-stack, guardrails-toolchain, tech-decision-research,
  enforceable-rules, ai-maintainer-principles) fire in main sessions and inherit-tier agents,
  not in `coder`.

Consequences for the verdict table: the two-tier redundancy bar stands (sonnet demonstrably
executes implementation work); trims backed by both-tier probes or owned by inherit-tier
consumers execute as written; trims resting on desk classification alone where `coder` is the
consumer (primary-keys P7/P8/P13/P14/P15-core, java-backend-api A15/A16/A18, money-storage
M-31/M-33, java-backend-rules R1/R8/R10/R23/R27) need a single-tier sonnet probe batch first —
sonnet failed the neighboring A5/A6 probe 0/2, so its unprobed api/schema discipline cannot be
assumed. The work list that drove the second addendum lived in
that repository's open-questions page and is not ported.

**The effort axis was then measured (2026-08-12):** the seven sonnet-failed cases re-run at
`--effort high` (claude-sonnet-5, CLI 2.1.228, 2 repeats, $4.91) went 3/14 → 6/14. High effort
rescued under-engineering (E34 SSRF pipeline and G4 gate-closure both 0-1/2 → 2/2) and **no
corpus-gravity default** — E5 outbox stayed 0/2 (one session named the dual-write problem in
prose and shipped `kafkaTemplate.send` in the transaction anyway), A56 error shapes 0/2, M5
partial totals 0/2, N13 and T6 still coin flips. Opus at default effort passed all fourteen.
Consequences: `coder` moved to `effort: high` (the cheap win, +13% measured session cost); the
sonnet-binding keep-verdicts stand unchanged — effort is not the lever for trap-shaped
defaults; and the bucket-B probe batch runs at **sonnet / effort high** to match the fleet.
Full table: that repository's `tools/agents-harness/evals/RESULTS.md`, not ported.

## Addendum 2026-08-12 (later) — the trim executed, with the bucket-B probe batch

**The probe-first bucket ran**: 12 new cases (`redundancy-cases.json`, ids `P7-id-capability` …
`R27-dispatch`), single-tier `claude-sonnet-5` at `--effort high` (matching `coder` since
2026-08-12), 2 repeats, CLI 2.1.228, 24/24 clean sessions, $3.42. Opus deliberately unprobed —
these directives were desk-classified pro-default and sonnet was the open question; single-tier
sonnet evidence plus the desk classification satisfies the two-tier bar for these rows only.

| probe | directive | sonnet (effort high) | conclusion |
|---|---|---|---|
| P7-id-capability | primary-keys P7: id is never a capability | 2/2 | pro-default — both designed a separate revocable share grant, rejecting key-in-URL on the not-a-secret ground |
| P8-business-number | primary-keys P8: two identifiers | 2/2 on the split | pro-default for the split core. **The renumbering ban binds**: one session proposed a rotatable account number — the immutability bullet stays untrimmed |
| P13-library-tables | primary-keys P13: library tables keep their key | 2/2 | pro-default — both refused the conforming migration and the FK into `flyway_schema_history` |
| P14-wire-id-string | primary-keys P14: ids as strings on the wire | 2/2 | pro-default — both declared the bigint id `type: string`, citing 2^53 themselves |
| P15-erasure | primary-keys P15 core: key survives erasure | 2/2 | pro-default — anonymize-in-place, key kept as pseudonym, no PII-derived key |
| A1516-wire-temporals | api A15/A16: RFC 3339 UTC instants, date-only business dates | 2/2 both halves | pro-default — `Instant` UTC `Z` + `At` name, `LocalDate` + `Date` name, no epoch numbers |
| A18-url-version | api A18: URL path version segment | 2/2 | pro-default — `/v1` with per-major committed contracts, header pipeline rejected unprompted |
| M3133-money-columns | money-storage M-31 constrained decimal / M-33 both-NOT-NULL | **M-31 0/2**; M-33 2/2 | **M-31 binds — desk classification refuted.** Neither session wrote a decimal column: both stored `bigint` minor units (Stripe-style), pushing the per-currency exponent onto every reader. M-33 pro-default |
| R1-web-stack | rules R1: Web MVC, WebFlux banned | 2/2 | pro-default — both picked servlet Web MVC and argued against reactive themselves |
| R8-schema-migrations | rules R8: committed Flyway migrations | 2/2 | pro-default — both set up versioned Flyway; one pinned `ddl-auto: validate` |
| R1023-json-injection | rules R10 Jackson / R23 constructor injection | 2/2 both halves | pro-default — Jackson, constructor injection, no `@Autowired` fields |
| R27-dispatch | rules R27: no reflection dispatch | 2/2 | pro-default — typed handler registry from declared beans, loud unknown-type failure, no `Class.forName` |

**Trims executed 2026-08-12** (probe-backed bucket-A trims from the 2026-08-11 run, plus the
bucket-B rows above): guardrails-toolchain G1/G6/G8/G11/G16 cores trimmed and G15 demoted with
its 4/4 result; money M-3/M-4 compacted to one tombstoned line and M-8 demoted; java-backend-rules
R20 demoted and R1/R8/R10/R23/R27 stamped (already one-liners — nothing to cut); llm-default-traps
T8 demoted to one line; ai-maintainer-principles A3 core and A11's non-ladder half trimmed;
java-backend-observability O14 compacted; money-java J4 compacted; caching's *Start by not caching*
ground rewritten to the probe-scoped claim; primary-keys P7/P8/P13/P14/P15 cores trimmed;
java-backend-api A15/A16/A18 stamped (already terse); money-storage M-33 demoted. **M-31's trim is
cancelled** and its binding probe result is recorded in the skill, including the measured
bare default (`bigint` minor units) added to its defaults list. E-34/E-35 stayed cancelled.

**Mapping caveat:** the Stage A triage tables did not survive into the repo, so bucket-A ids were
mapped to skill headings by document order, verified against the probe-case anchors (G4, G15, P6,
R20, A5/A6). **G16 could not be located with certainty**; the only "schedule window" content in
guardrails-toolchain is the standing sweep's schedule layer clause (the GitHub
inactivity-disabling fact), so its core prose was trimmed and the dated forge facts kept. If the
triage meant something else by G16, the trim landed on adjacent pro-default material and nothing
contra was removed.

**Token yield, measured (`npm run tokens`, o200k_base, SKILL.md tier, before → after):**
guardrails-toolchain 9637 → 9500 (−137), ai-maintainer-principles 8630 → 8547 (−83),
primary-keys 12375 → 12337 (−38), money-java 3731 → 3726 (−5), java-backend-observability
6150 → 6168 (+18), llm-default-traps 6062 → 6101 (+39), java-backend-api 7513 → 7556 (+43),
money 3802 → 3873 (+71), caching 9397 → 9481 (+84), money-storage 6538 → 6634 (+96),
java-backend-rules 9193 → 9389 (+196). **Net ≈ +284 — the trim's token yield is approximately
zero.** The finding to carry forward: the execution constraints (keep dated verifications,
demote with the recorded probe result, tombstone every removal) cost 15–40 tokens per directive,
which exceeds the cut on any directive already written tersely — a real trim payoff exists only
where a pro-default directive carries long reasoning prose (guardrails cores, A3/A11). Three
files grew by mandate, not by failure: money-storage carries M-31's new binding evidence, caching
carries the required probe-scoped reword, java-backend-rules' five pro-default rows were already
one-liners so demotion is pure addition. **What the exercise actually bought is calibration, not
tokens**: every trim-class directive now states inline whether it is measured instinct or an
instinct-override, with the model tier and date.

## What this audit does not decide

- Verdicts are **model-relative and dated**: measured on `claude-sonnet-5` and `claude-opus-5`, CLI 2.1.227, 2026-08-11. A directive redundant here may bind on a weaker deployed model; re-check on deployment-model change.
- N=2 per tier per case. A 4/4-compliant directive is a trim *candidate*, not a proven redundancy; a single violation anywhere is decisive the other way.
- Unprobed contested rows stay contested. Desk classifications outside the probe set are the model's self-judgment — `convention`-grade evidence in this repo's vocabulary.
- Probes measure the **unloaded** model. A directive can be pro-default in isolation and still earn its tokens by surviving context pressure in long sessions; nothing here measures that.
- Skill-level worth is per-firing token cost vs bound directives (`npm run tokens`), not directive counts. Trim verdicts name directives, never whole skills, unless every directive fell.
