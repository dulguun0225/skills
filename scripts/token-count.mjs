// Token count of the directive text this repo ships, `evidence.md` excluded.
//
// What it is for: a SKILL.md is loaded into a scarce context window whole, every
// time its skill fires, and nothing else in this repo measures that cost. The
// exclusion is the point — `evidence.md` is read by a human deciding whether to
// trust a rule set, never by the agent following it, so its size is not a cost
// the consumer pays. Every other markdown file in a skill dir is counted:
// `api.md`, `storage.md`, `shapes.md` and `gates.md` are directive text one hop away, loaded
// on demand and paid for when they are.
//
// This is a PER-FIRING cost, not a per-session one. Only frontmatter is loaded
// unconditionally, and `npm run tokens:frontmatter` is the number for that. A
// skill that never fires costs its description and nothing here. The totals
// below are therefore a worst case — every skill installed and every one fired —
// and no real consumer pays them.
//
// The tokenizer is o200k_base (`gpt-tokenizer`), which is exact for GPT models
// and an APPROXIMATION for Claude — Anthropic ships no offline tokenizer, and
// the exact count is an API call per file per run. Treat the number as good to
// roughly ten percent, and as reliable for direction and ranking.
//
// A report, not a gate. Always exits 0; there is no budget here to fail against.

What this count does not decide:
  - whether any of it is waste; a long rule set can be exactly as long as it
    needs to be, and this measures size, not redundancy
  - what a consumer actually pays. These are per-firing costs summed as if every
    skill were installed and every one fired; the unconditional cost is
    frontmatter only, and no consumer here installs all of them
  - the true Claude count; o200k_base is a different tokenizer, and code ticks,
    tables and long hyphenated names are where the two diverge most
  - anything about evidence.md, which is excluded by design and unmeasured
  - whether a resource file is reachable at all; that is check:pointers
