// The evidence-order check, from `enforceable-rules` — "Wiring the gates", item 1.
//
// Every subheading in an evidence file names a real section of the directive
// text, and those subheadings run in the directive text's order. What it is for:
// an accreting rule set silently reorganises itself by research date, and the
// reader who arrives from a directive heading then cannot find its grounds.
//
// Three exact failure conditions, no similarity heuristics. A drift detector
// scored on heading-name overlap was written first and dropped: every one of
// the five hits it produced against this repo was a coincidence between a
// structural evidence section and a directive of similar vocabulary.
//
// Exit 1 on any failure. It fails the build; it is not advisory.

// Skills whose evidence file is organised by research pass rather than by
// directive, so it anchors to nothing and the order half of this check has no
// purchase on it. Declared here rather than inferred, because an evidence file
// that anchors to nothing is exactly what a silent reorganisation looks like —
// the difference is that these were written that way and reviewed that way.
// Adding a name here is a decision; leaving one out fails the build.
//
// The list shrinks as evidence files gain directive-named sections. It lost
// `guardrails-toolchain` on 2026-08-02, when that skill's worked case moved into
// its evidence file under the directive heading it had in the body — one anchored
// heading is enough to make the declaration stale, and the check says so by name
// rather than tolerating it.
