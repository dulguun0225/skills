// Token count of skill frontmatter — the only part of a skill that is loaded
// unconditionally.
//
// Why it is a separate number from `npm run tokens`. Skill loading is three
// tiers, and only the first is paid whether the skill is used or not:
//
//   1. session start — `name` and `description` of every installed skill go
//      into the system prompt, so the agent can decide what is relevant. Paid
//      every session and every turn, for skills that never fire. THIS SCRIPT.
//   2. skill fires — the SKILL.md body loads. Paid per invocation. `npm run
//      tokens` measures that.
//   3. resource file read — `evidence.md`, `api.md`, `storage.md`, `shapes.md`
//      load only if the body points at one and the agent opens it. Often never.
//
// The consequence for authoring: a long `description` is expensive in a way a
// long body is not, because nobody chose to load it. It is also the only text
// that decides whether the skill fires at all, so short is not automatically
// better — this reports the price, not the verdict.
//
// Counted per key, because `description` is the payload and `name` is overhead
// no one can trim. The number is an approximation twice over: o200k_base is not
// Claude's tokenizer, and the harness renders the listing in its own format
// rather than pasting raw YAML, so the delimiters and the `name:`/`description:`
// keys are this script's guess at that framing rather than a measurement of it.
//
// A report, not a gate. Always exits 0 — except on a frontmatter shape it cannot
// count honestly, which it names and exits 1 for.

What this count does not decide:
  - whether a description is too long; it is also the only thing that makes the
    skill fire, and an unfired skill costs its description and delivers nothing

    own format, so the framing column is this script's guess at that cost
  - the true Claude count; o200k_base is a different tokenizer
  - what a given consumer pays, which depends on which skills they installed
