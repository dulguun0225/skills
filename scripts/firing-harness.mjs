// Does a skill in this set actually fire?

// Every other script here measures text. This one runs sessions: it stands up a
// sandbox holding nothing but this repo's skills, sends a headless `claude -p` a
// prompt an engineer would plausibly type, and records which skills the agent
// chose to load. Firing is decided by frontmatter alone — the `SKILL.md` body and
// every resource file beside it are invisible until after the choice is made — so
// this is the only check here that reaches the `description`.
//
// It is a report, not a gate. It spends money, it is stochastic, and a single
// miss is a coin flip rather than a defect. Never wire it into `npm run gates`.

//   node scripts/firing-harness.mjs                       every case, working tree
//   node scripts/firing-harness.mjs --skill money         cases for one skill
//   node scripts/firing-harness.mjs --case money-1        one case
//   node scripts/firing-harness.mjs --repeats 3           firing is stochastic
//   node scripts/firing-harness.mjs --against HEAD~1      A/B a frontmatter edit
//   node scripts/firing-harness.mjs --model opus          pin the model; see below

//
// TWO MODES, measuring two different things. The default denies every tool but
// Skill and caps the turns low, so it scores whether a skill fires as the
// model's FIRST action. That is the cheap question, and for repo-fixture cases
// with execution-shaped prompts it is the wrong one: measured 2026-08-03,
// Opus's first move in a concrete repo is to look at code. --explore allows
// Read, Glob, Grep, Write and Edit inside the disposable sandbox, raises the
// turn cap, and scores whether the skill under test loaded BEFORE the first
// Write or Edit — fired-but-late is reported as its own verdict, because rules
// that arrive after the code is written did not govern it. Explore sessions
// cost several times a first-move session. The two modes' rates are different
// measurements; never compare across them.
//
// THE DENIAL WAS NOT REAL BEFORE 2026-08-03, AND EVERY FIRST-MOVE RATE TAKEN
// BEFORE THEN IS VOID. `--allowed-tools` is an auto-approve list, not a
// restriction; only `--disallowed-tools` removes a tool. Passing
// `--allowed-tools Skill` therefore restricted nothing, and the deny list
// beside it named `Bash` while the Windows shell tool is called `PowerShell`.
// A probe session read the whole fixture with `Get-ChildItem -Recurse`, spent
// its second turn on `ToolSearch` asking for the five tools that were denied,
// and died at the turn cap — recorded as "nothing fired", indistinguishable
// from a relevance judgment. So the platform gap this file agonised over is
// not one: the linux runs had `Bash` in the deny list and were near-sealed,
// the win32 runs had an open shell. Different experiments, not comparable
// rates. The fix is not a longer list — it is `PERMITTED` below plus the
// assertion in `parseSession`, which fails any session that used a tool the
// mode does not permit. A deny list can only ever omit the tool the CLI added
// last week; the assertion cannot.
//
// ACROSS MACHINES: it runs anywhere the `claude` CLI runs and is logged in —
// nothing here is bound to one developer's box. What does not travel is the
// NUMBER. A firing rate is a measurement of one model reading one description
// under one CLI version, so a rate taken on another machine is comparable only
// when both are the same. Every run stamps both, and every rate written down
// anywhere must carry that stamp. Pass --model to pin one deliberately.

/**
 * The fixture a case runs in, as a path-to-content map.
 *
 * A FIXTURE MUST CONTAIN WHAT ITS PROMPTS POINT AT. Until 2026-08-03 the java
 * box was a pom and two files while prompts named a TaxService, a ReceiptService
 * and a GET /customers, so the model looked, found nothing, asked for it and
 * stopped — scored as "nothing fired" with no relevance judgment having
 * happened. That was most of the miss list in both modes. When a case is added,
 * either its referent goes in here or the prompt stops naming one.
 *
 * The code is deliberately ORDINARY, not exemplary: doubles for money, a plain
 * string 400 body, a lookup per request. Writing it the way the skills prescribe
 * would answer the prompt before the model read it. The opposite risk is real
 * and unmeasured — a fixture exhibiting the exact defect a skill bans may cue
 * that skill by itself — so a rate is a rate for THIS fixture, and changing
 * these files starts a new baseline.

Status: accepted
Date: 2024-03-11

## Context

We need to move receipt generation and partner exports off the request thread.
Two of us have run RabbitMQ before. Kafka was considered and rejected: at our
volume (about 40 messages a second at peak) the operational cost of a broker
cluster is not worth it, and the managed Kafka offerings we priced were roughly
four times the cost of a managed RabbitMQ instance.

## Decision

RabbitMQ, single node to start, with a mirrored queue added when we have a
second availability zone.

## Consequences

- No replay of consumed messages. If a consumer loses a message it is gone.
- Ordering is per-queue only.
- We revisit this if sustained throughput passes 500 messages a second.

What this run does not decide:
  - whether a miss is a defect. Firing is stochastic; one miss is a coin flip.
    Re-run the case with --repeats before touching a description
  - what a real session does. ${args.explore ? `Explore mode allows the read and edit
    tools, but the sandbox still has no CLAUDE.md, no user, and a ${MAX_TURNS}-turn cap` : `Only ${PERMITTED.join(", ")} was permitted, so the
    model could not look at the repo before choosing, and a real agent can —
    repo-fixture rates in this mode are first-move rates, not delivery (see
    docs/history/firing-harness.md, 2026-08-03)`}
  - whether the prompt's subject exists in the fixture. Several cases name code
    the fixture does not contain; those sessions ask for it and stop, and that
    reports as a miss without any relevance judgment having happened
  - whether the skill that fired was the right one to fire. This scores the
    skill under test and records the rest; it never says a skill was wrong to load
  - anything about the body. Firing is decided by frontmatter alone, so a skill
    can fire perfectly and still be wrong once open
  - whether the corpus is fair. A prompt written from a description tests string
    matching; these were written as engineer requests, and that is a judgement
    call renewed every time a case is added`);
