// Token count of each `##` section of each SKILL.md — where a body's per-firing
// cost actually sits.
//
// Why it exists separately from `npm run tokens`. That script says which skill
// is expensive; this one says which part of it is, which is the only form the
// answer can take when the question is "what could move to `evidence.md`". Every
// figure in docs/history/context-budget.md came from a one-off counter that was
// never committed, so those numbers were not re-runnable and would decay like
// every other count this repo has recorded. This is that counter, committed.
//
// SKILL.md only. Resource files (`api.md`, `storage.md`, `shapes.md`, `gates.md`) are one
// hop away and paid on demand; `evidence.md` is never paid by an agent at all.
// The tier this reports is the one that loads whole, every time a skill fires.
//
// Sections are `##` headings outside code fences, as a reader sees them. Text
// before the first one is charged to `(frontmatter + intro)`, because it is
// paid the same way. Per-section counts sum to slightly more than the file:
// nothing is double counted, but each section is encoded on its own and the
// tokenizer merges across boundaries differently than it does in one pass.
//
// Same tokenizer caveat as the other two reports: o200k_base is exact for GPT
// models and an APPROXIMATION for Claude. Read the ranking, not the number.
//
// A report, not a gate. Always exits 0; there is no budget here to fail against.

What this count does not decide:

  - where a section could move to. Evidence can leave the body for evidence.md

    paid by the agent that opens it, and is still counted by \`npm run tokens\`
  - the true Claude count; o200k_base is a different tokenizer, and tables and
    code ticks are where the two diverge most
  - anything about the per-session cost — that is \`npm run tokens:frontmatter\`,
    and it is the tier paid whether a skill fires or not
