// This is the sequence the template's README lists as four commands, run as one, with the template pinned
// to a recorded commit instead of whatever `main` is today. Nothing here is a decision: the stack and every
// gate are fixed by the template, the rename is the template's own scripts/init.mjs, and the output for a
// given (ref, package, name) is byte-identical every time. An agent that is about to scaffold a Java backend
// runs this and then starts on domain code; anything it would write during scaffolding is the defect.
//
// Two shapes, matching the template's two modes:
//   vendored (default)  <dir>/ is a project root; the template lands in <dir>/backend/ by `git subtree add`
//                       and init.mjs lifts project-root/ (root CI, ruleset, compose, frontend stub, spec-kit
//                       constitution, project CLAUDE.md) one level up.
//   --standalone        <dir>/ is the service itself; the template's own .github/workflows/ci.yml is its CI.
//
// What it does not do, on purpose: create the forge repository, push, apply the branch ruleset, install the
// skills, run `specify init`. Each of those has side effects outside this directory and is printed as the
// next step. `--skip-verify` skips codegen and `mvn verify`, which need Docker and minutes; the commit it
// makes then records an unverified tree and says so.
//
// Node, standard library only, 22 or newer: the runtime `npx skills add` already needed to install this skill,
// so it runs the same on Linux, macOS and Windows. Needs git and mvn on PATH.

// The pinned template commit. Move it deliberately, in a commit that says which gate change it brings in.
// Recorded 2026-09-26: "gates: any feature reads any table; only the owner writes it" on main.
// TableOwnershipTest no longer fails a feature that reads another feature's table; it fails a method that starts
// a write and names a table its feature does not own, proven on starterfixtures.ownership, and constitution
// Article VI says the same (ai-maintainer-principles *Count the independent wills*). Verified at this pin: a full
// vendored run of this script against a local clone (TEMPLATE_URL), mvn verify green, its own init: commit made.
// On top of "gates: strict request bodies — identifiers in the path only, one request type per
// operation", recorded 2026-09-25 on main. Every @RequestBody binds as BoundBody<T> through StrictJsonBodyConverter, which refuses
// undeclared members, members named after a path variable and wrong JSON types; RequestBodyContractTest,
// StrictBodyEndpointIT and the vacuum rule request-body-schemas-are-closed gate it, and constitution Article IV
// states it for the plan stage (java-backend-api *Request bodies*). Verified at this pin: a full vendored run of
// this script for package mn.netgroup.netcore.pintest, mvn verify green, its own init: commit made. On top of
// "docs: the project CLAUDE.md states the base branch in one line", recorded 2026-09-25. Both CLAUDE.md
// files gain the line `Base branch: \`main\``, beside the definition-of-done command, which build-feature reads
// from the repository root's CLAUDE.md; main is the trunk this script's `git init -b main` makes. No build input
// changed, so mvn verify was not re-run for this pin; verified by a --skip-verify vendored run of this script
// against a local clone (TEMPLATE_URL), whose root CLAUDE.md carried the line. On top of
// "init: the printed procedure formats after the rename, before the wall", recorded 2026-09-21.
// The template's init.mjs message and README procedure gain `mvn spotless:apply` between codegen and verify,
// matching step 5 below. Verified at this pin: a full run of this script for package mn.netgroup.netcore.fmttest,
// codegen, format and `mvn verify` green, its own init: commit made, 2026-09-21. On top of
// "constitution: Article VII reads "None", not "Add what this product decides"" on
// main, with "docs: /speckit.constitution is not a step; Article VII is an optional slot" under it. No gate
// changes: the scaffolded README, project CLAUDE.md and constitution stop listing /speckit.constitution as what
// follows the scaffold, and Article VII states that empty is complete instead of asking to be filled. Two
// projects scaffolded from the previous pin the same day carried the old wording, which is why the pin moves
// for a docs change. mvn verify was not re-run for this pin; the diff from 4a1c6fd touches no build input. On top of
// "gate: specs are written here, so provenance is not a layer the gate holds".
// A feature's spec.md is now written directly in the service repo by a domain expert with stock spec-kit and
// build work starts at /speckit-plan, so the upstream half of the traceability gate is gone: no
// specs/trace-upstreams.tsv, no specs/trace-upstream-dropped.tsv, no pinned copies under specs/upstream/, no
// scripts/refresh-upstream-snapshot.mjs. The gate keeps only the shape: a <QUALIFIER>/FR-nnn token whose
// qualifier is not a feature number is prose -- it resolves nothing, covers nothing and is not the bare id it
// wraps. The scaffolded CLAUDE.md says who owns spec.md. On top of
// "gates: a listed-but-absent build file carries no flags to find": `check-forbidden-flags.mjs` had the same
// latent shape as the traceability gate's own fix two commits below: it read every path `git ls-files` handed it unguarded, so a tracked build or deploy file this script's
// `init.mjs` removes before the first commit -- listed by the index, absent on disk -- died with an uncaught
// ENOENT instead of a verdict. Such a path is now skipped there too, and any other read error fails the gate
// naming the file. `squawk-changed-migrations.mjs` has the same shape of read but does not crash the same way
// (squawk-cli reads the files itself and a missing one is its own "Configuration error" exit); this template
// has no gate that owns refusing a deleted shipped migration, so it was left unguarded rather than made to
// silently skip a deletion nothing else here would catch. On top of
// "gates: a tracked file deleted from the working tree carries no citations", which fixes the traceability
// gate the same way on exactly the tree this script produces. On top of
// "gates: an upstream citation resolves against a pinned copy of its document", of which what survives is
// that every requirement of a feature that has a tasks.md is named by a task; on top of
// "gates: spec<->code traceability, with the canary that proves it" (a project
// scaffolded from this pin refuses a bare requirement id from its first commit), "scaffold: project-level
// .claude/settings.json pins worktree.baseRef=head" (an agent worktree starts from the session's HEAD, not
// main), #9 (guarded version update, ORDER BY id ban, table ownership, vacuum ruleset, migration lint
// additions) and #8 (Article VI names no package; CLAUDE.md holds the pointer).
