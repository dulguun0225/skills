name: java-backend-rules
description: The platform constitution for a Java backend on Spring Boot Web MVC, jOOQ and PostgreSQL — the rules that bind every line of code in the repo, each with a named build gate. Reactive WebFlux, JPA and Hibernate, jOOQ's attached-record CRUD, plain-SQL strings, an injectable DSLContext, fixed thread pools for request work, StructuredTaskScope, an extra semaphore over the connection pool, wall-clock reads in domain code, and the runtime-silent Spring annotations — field injection, @Transactional, @Scheduled, @Async, @Cacheable — are banned by name, each with the check that fails the build. Load before writing a query, a transaction, an in-request fan-out, a Flyway migration, a scheduled task, or a test on this stack, and before picking a persistence, concurrency, JSON or nullness library for it.

# Java backend — the platform rules

Rules bind **every line of code** in Java backend on this stack, plus named check enforce each. Six area — platform picks, concurrency, time, nullness, runtime-silent ban list, test toolchain.

Two sibling skill carry area with own condition. Repo on this stack install all three:

- **`java-backend-api`** — HTTP contract rules. Bind when backend expose HTTP API described by OpenAPI doc.
- **`java-backend-observability`** — logging, metrics, alerting. Bind when deployed system have no human watching continuously.

**No rule ids here, deliberate.** Each directive be `###` heading; heading be how you refer to it — *the transaction seam*, *the preview-API ban*, *the fan-out helper*. Nothing else in skill set number these, so invented number point nowhere except repo that install this skill; skill name plus subject read as instruction, resolve either way. Cite these rules same way from anywhere.

## The marker ceiling, before the rules

**Evidence behind six area uneven, and unevenness run by area not by rule.** Read first — rule stating check look equally settled whichever group it in.

- **Every Concurrency claim re-verified 2026-07-24 under three-vote adversarial panel**; survivor carry **confirmed**. One starting claim **refuted** there, rule rewritten around refutation — see *The keep-alive safeguard*. No ranking against other group here intended, none against other skill in set: several had own panelled pass.
- **Persistence claims marked confirmed checked against primary vendor doc, no panel** (2026-07-25) — jOOQ attached-record CRUD and fetch cardinality, plain-SQL injection hazard, lambda-scoped transaction API and autocommit, four migration hazard. **Mandates** built on them be this rule set own synthesis, and say so.
- **So *confirmed* mean two thing in this skill; date be only teller.** Against claim dated **2026-07-21** or **2026-07-24** it mean claim survive three independent refutation vote — both pass run panel. Against **2026-07-25** it mean one researcher check against primary source — **pass wrote "confirmed" while running no panel**. That usage carried here not silently corrected, because re-marking someone else verdict not what converting do. Read 2026-07-25 *confirmed* as documentation check. **2026-07-27** carry one panelled claim, belong to `java-backend-observability` not this skill; correction it made to rule here dated to it. Nothing here dated **2026-06-11..14** and marked confirmed — that pass record no per-claim marker at all.
- **Nullness confirmed** mainstream (2026-07-21) — panelled date, so strong sense.
- **Time, ban list, real-database test rule be convention, no citation at all.** No external evidence survive for any. Kept because enforceable, cheap, fail toward safety — **enforcement never confirmation**, and green ArchUnit run say nothing about ban being good idea.
- **Three Platform directive carry no own evidence note** — WebFlux paradigm ban, Flyway-migrations rule, Jackson pick. Their dating be inference drawn while writing this skill, not date any research pass wrote. [evidence.md](evidence.md) say so where it state them.

Whole set `review-by` **2027-01-21**. **Past that date every *confirmed* marker read as *convention*** until new pass re-date it, no maintainer action needed. Rule only work if date visible beside claim — why every directive carry one.

Status tier: **decided, not yet validated** — researched and decided, **no production use yet** behind enforcement shapes.

## The premise, and the thing it is not

**Code written by LLM agents, no human read it line by line.**

Every rule conditioned on that. Verdict portable exactly as far as premise: in repo where human read every diff, several drop from mandatory to merely advisable, and repo in that position should say so and carry burden of saying it, not silently drop rule.

**This skill not argument for choosing this stack.** It assume platform decision — Java, Spring Boot Web MVC, jOOQ, PostgreSQL — already made, and state rules that follow. **Rule set never reason to adopt stack**, and this one not evidence for own platform: fifteen sibling skill on one stack be accumulated *consequence*, not accumulated justification.

**Argument for choice live in `backend-stack`**, which rank candidate by what their build can refuse to ship, carry this stack as worked case. If platform still open, read that skill and come back. Two thing it settle that this paragraph used to state differently: **deciding criterion be stack enforcement surface, not operability** — operability be veto winner must clear, different thing, different answer, because "we already know it" not guardrail when nobody read code. And candidate list behind Java verdict — C#/.NET, Kotlin, Go, TypeScript, each with ground it lost on — **recovered 2026-08-01 and published in `backend-stack`**, not here; what still missing there be primary source per ground and re-open trigger per loser, which that skill state about itself rather than leave to be inferred from silence here.

**Three tripwire mean repo left this skill assumptions entirely**, not merely added feature: first LLM call in product, hard real-time deadline, shipped SDK. None covered here; rules below written with none in view.

## The defaults these rules override

Picks unbriefed agent statistically make. **Naming loser be load-bearing half** — "use jOOQ" not override instinct, "corpus default be JPA with dirty checking, rejected because accidentally mutated entity become silent UPDATE" do. Do not compress these when carrying rule into repo own text.

- **JPA, Hibernate, Spring Data JPA** — corpus-dominant Java persistence. Rejected as runtime-silent: dirty checking turn accidentally mutated entity into silent `UPDATE`, and silence most expensive where money move. **Corpus advantage self-cancel** — every future agent session generate against corpus gravity toward banned patterns, which be cost this ban pay for.
- **Annotation-driven transactions, caching, scheduling** — corpus default Spring style, banned as runtime-silent. See *The runtime-silent ban list*.
- **Fixed-size platform-thread request pool** — classic Tomcat and executor tuning, and do-nothing default. Under blocking Web MVC plus jOOQ it reintroduce thread-pool exhaustion, because slow database call starve request thread under load. Virtual threads remove exactly that failure mode, keep identical blocking top-to-bottom code shape.
- **Manually pooling virtual threads** — fixed or cached pool of them. Defeat point: pooling reintroduce scarce-resource bottleneck they designed to remove, and pooled virtual thread caching per-thread state just reallocate per task.
- **Raw `newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor` plus `Future.get` loop for in-request fan-out** — compile, pass happy-path test, silently wrong. See *The fan-out helper*.
- **Adopting `StructuredTaskScope` now** — ergonomically attractive fan-out API, preview on JDK 25. Dominant corpus shape for it (JDK 21–24 `ShutdownOnFailure` and `ShutdownOnSuccess` constructors) **not even compile on JDK 25** — the corpus-poisoning these rules exist to prevent.
- **Extra `Semaphore` on top of connection pool to limit database load** — redundant. Pool already block caller past its size.
- **Regenerating jOOQ classes against live or shared database** — path of least resistance, make generated tree function of whatever that database happen to hold.

**More corpus default rejected by rules living elsewhere in this skill set**, because their rules do; named here only so reader not conclude stack have no verdict. Binary floating-point for amounts, reaching for money library — `money`, `money-api`, `money-storage`, `money-java` skills. Spring `@Cacheable` and cache abstraction, reaching for Caffeine or Guava outside cache adapter — `caching` and `caching-java` skills. `@KafkaListener` on handler, broker publish beside repository save — `async-handoff` family. Cross-cutting dependency traps binding any agent-built repo on any stack — `llm-default-traps`, also this stack owner of record for jqwik version pin.

## Platform

### Java and Spring Boot Web MVC, with WebFlux banned as a paradigm

**Java at version pinned in build, Spring Boot with servlet Web MVC stack. Reactive WebFlux banned as paradigm** — one concurrency model be blocking thread-per-request on virtual threads, and second model in same repo mean every later piece of code must answer which one it in.

*ArchUnit — off-the-shelf. **Convention**, 2026-06-11..14 — platform pass decision; no note in evidence trail address WebFlux ban directly. **Nothing about this ban confirmed**: virtual-thread claims the alternative measured against be, but one-concurrency-model argument itself be reasoning no pass put to source. See [evidence.md](evidence.md).*

### jOOQ against PostgreSQL, with JPA banned

**Persistence be jOOQ against PostgreSQL; JPA, Hibernate, Spring Data JPA banned** — no entity lifecycle, no lazy loading, no query derivation.

*Banned-dependency plus ArchUnit rules — off-the-shelf. **Convention**, 2026-06-11..14. Dirty-checking hazard class confirmed against jOOQ own doc for equivalent jOOQ construct — see *jOOQ's own runtime-silent CRUD* — but platform pass recorded rejections and grounds without per-claim confidence marker, so convention be floor rather than verdict it wrote down.*

### jOOQ classes are generated from the committed migrations

**Regenerate committed jOOQ classes from committed Flyway migrations, never from live or shared database.** Migrations applied to throwaway real PostgreSQL in container, so generated tree be pure function of committed migrations.

*Bespoke — CI job regenerate and fail on any git diff. **Convention**, verified 2026-07-25 — mechanism be jOOQ own documented recommendation; that it mandatory here be this rule set synthesis, because jOOQ present it as one recommended approach not only one.*

### jOOQ's own runtime-silent CRUD is banned

**Attached-record writes banned; writes be explicit DSL statements.** `UpdatableRecord.store()`, `insert()`, `update()`, `delete()`, `refresh()`, plus `changed()` / `touched()` / `modified()` dirty flags, pick INSERT-versus-UPDATE **and** which column to write from in-memory record state that never appear in query text. That be dirty checking under another name — exact hazard this stack rejected JPA for, shipped inside library that replaced it. Records detached repo-wide with `Settings.withAttachRecords(false)`, so these methods **throw rather than guess**.

*ArchUnit — off-the-shelf host; owner-typed `UpdatableRecord` predicate authored per repo, plus config-default assertion, wired by repo, that `withAttachRecords` stay false. Generated jOOQ packages excluded. **Confirmed** against primary jOOQ documentation, verified 2026-07-25.*

### Fetch with `fetchSingle` or `fetchOptional`

**`fetchOne()` and `fetchAny()` banned.** They hide result cardinality: `fetchOne()` return null on zero rows, throw only on more than one, so query that must match exactly one **silently tolerate zero**; `fetchAny()` silently return arbitrary row when several match. `fetchSingle()` throw on zero and on more than one; `fetchOptional()` cover legitimately-optional case.

*ArchUnit — off-the-shelf host; ban on `fetchOne` / `fetchAny` call targets, or Error Prone check on source. **Confirmed** against primary jOOQ documentation, verified 2026-07-25.*

### Plain-SQL `String` constructs are banned

**`DSL.sql`, `field(String)`, `condition(String)`, `table(String)`, `query(String)`, `resultQuery(String)`, `fetch(String)` banned.** Each splice raw string into query tree, defeat jOOQ compile-time type checking, reopen SQL-injection surface type-safe DSL close. If repo need one, **confine to as few named seams as possible** — reference shape use one — each test-pinned named constant, and annotate only that scope `@Allow.PlainSQL`.

*ArchUnit ban on plain-SQL API by signature, generated packages excluded — off-the-shelf host, per-repo predicate. **jOOQ own `PlainSQLChecker` be stronger path**: turn any plain-SQL use into compile error unless scope annotated. Verify it wire against pinned JDK and Error Prone at adoption — that wiring unverified here. Hazard **confirmed** (verified 2026-07-25); single-seam discipline **convention**.*

### SQL is reached only through the one transaction seam

**Code touch SQL only inside lambda-scoped transaction block that receive context as parameter** — `tx.read(dsl -> ...)` and `tx.write(dsl -> ...)` in reference shape, method names be repo call — **and read-only intent be method name, not annotation. `DSLContext` not injectable bean.** Injected `DSLContext` used outside block run in autocommit, commit each statement on own, invisibly. Banning injection make unscoped query **unwritable**, not only reviewed against.

*ArchUnit — off-the-shelf host; no-injectable-`DSLContext` predicate authored per repo. That seam also own connection acquisition, so no `Connection` or `DSLContext` reachable outside transaction block, be **convention**. Two facts underneath — jOOQ own transaction API be lambda-scoped, and JDBC connection created in autocommit mode — be **confirmed**, verified 2026-07-25; mandate be this rule set governance choice.*

**This seam be shared resource, and two other published skill add requirement to it this directive not state.** `caching` require cache invalidation reachable only from seam **post-commit registration**; `async-handoff` require general-purpose post-commit callback registration **not** exist, because nothing at call site would then distinguish cache delete from message publish. Repo wiring this seam alongside either read their rules before fixing seam shape — this rule fix transaction boundary, not post-commit surface.

### Schema changes are committed Flyway migrations

**Schema changes be committed Flyway SQL migrations,** applied in integration tests against real PostgreSQL.

*Convention — integration-test setup be check. Dated 2026-06-11..14, only pass whose scope cover it; no evidence note carry this rule, and dating be inference drawn while writing this skill.*

### Every migration is linted for lock and rewrite hazards

**Lint every committed migration for lock and rewrite hazard, not only that it apply.** Migration running clean against empty test database can still take `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock or rewrite table at production volume — exactly gap test-time rule above leave open. Four operation flagged, unwritable without reviewed per-migration opt-out: non-`CONCURRENT` index build, table-rewriting column-type change, `ADD ... NOT NULL` without default, constraint added without `NOT VALID` followed by later `VALIDATE`.

*squawk — off-the-shelf. Plain CLI gate on exit code over migrations in diff, **not pull-request comment bot**; enabled rule set and per-migration opt-outs configured per repo. Four hazards **confirmed** against PostgreSQL own documentation (verified 2026-07-25); choice of squawk over alternatives be **convention** — rule be hazard class, not vendor.*

**`DROP COLUMN` deliberately not on that list.** It be expand-and-contract compatibility concern, not documented lock-or-rewrite hazard; adding it would put rule with different ground behind gate that not evidence for it.

### JSON is Jackson

**JSON be Jackson.**

*Convention. Dated 2026-06-11..14 by same inference as Flyway rule; no evidence note carry it.*

## Concurrency

One concurrency model be virtual threads — synchronous, top-to-bottom, un-colored code. **Win be bounded, not free throughput.** PostgreSQL be ceiling, so this remove thread-pool exhaustion and keep blocking shape at scale; not throughput multiplier, and adopting it as one produce disappointed team and rule set nobody trust.

### Virtual threads are enabled by one property

**`spring.threads.virtual.enabled=true` in committed config.**

*Config-default assertion — off-the-shelf. **Confirmed** 2026-07-24. **Check read checked-in default, not effective runtime value**, which env vars or external config can override — see *Named gaps*. Introducing framework version be **convention**, re-verify against pinned Spring Boot line at adoption.*

### The keep-alive safeguard is recommended, not required

**`spring.main.keep-alive=true` be recommended safeguard, not requirement for this stack.** Enabling virtual threads make Spring threads daemon threads, but embedded servlet server keep own non-daemon thread, so actively-serving Web MVC app **not exit without it**. Matter in no-web-server or scheduled-task-only mode.

*Convention, 2026-07-24. **"Required" framing refuted by panel — do not restore it**, and do not cite keep-alive as required for request handling. This be one directive in this skill written around refutation not confirmation.*

### One virtual thread per task, never pooled

**Fork with `Thread.startVirtualThread` or `Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()`. Fixed-size `ExecutorService` for request or in-request work banned;** one platform-thread executor factory whitelisted for pinning fallback.

*ArchUnit — off-the-shelf host; whitelist predicate authored per repo. **Confirmed** 2026-07-24 — platform own guidance state virtual threads should never be pooled.*

### Bound concurrency at the limited resource, not at the thread count

**Do not throttle load by capping threads.** HikariCP pool be database semaphore — small fixed size matched to what PostgreSQL can serve, **never scaled to thread count**; thousands of virtual threads queue on it. Gate any non-database limited resource with explicit `java.util.concurrent.Semaphore`. **Do not add second semaphore on top of pool.**

*Convention — pool sizing be repo call; pool-as-limiter principle be rule. Underlying claim **confirmed** 2026-07-24, platform own words — connection pool already serve as semaphore, need no additional one.*

### Never fan out to database work while holding a connection

**Never fan out to database-touching subtasks while holding connection or open transaction.** Held connection plus subtasks each checking out connection can **deadlock small pool**. Acquire after fan-out join, or size pool by deadlock-avoidance formula.

*Convention — spec and review; **not statically detectable**, and this be one rule here with no possible build gate. Verified 2026-07-24 — deadlock mechanics and sizing formula primary-sourced; mapping onto virtual-thread fan-out be this rule set synthesis.*

### The fan-out helper

**In-request fan-out go through repo one canonical virtual-thread fan-out helper.** It fork one virtual thread per subtask in try-with-resources, cancel siblings on first failure, join all, aggregate exceptions. **Hand-rolled `Future.get` loops and raw executor fan-out in request code banned** — `ExecutorService.close()` neither cancel siblings nor short-circuit, so corpus-generated shape either run every sibling after one already failed, or serialize fan-out through sequential `get()` calls. Trade safe compile error for silent latency-and-correctness defect.

*Bespoke — one owned helper plus ArchUnit ban on raw executor fan-out in request paths. **Convention**, 2026-07-24. `close()` semantics this rest on be stated in rejected-alternatives record, not in dated evidence note with primary source — see [evidence.md](evidence.md).*

**This helper carry second obligation stated in `java-backend-observability` — establishing each subtask logging context at fork time.** That rest on one claim in that skill area put to adversarial panel; panel produced **two** rules there, context capture and logging-backend pin, and that skill mark both **confirmed**. Repo building helper from this directive alone build it without context capture, and every subtask log line then lose correlation fields silently.

### No preview APIs

**Do not use preview APIs; never pass `--enable-preview` to `javac` or to `java` launcher,** in Maven or Gradle. This **categorically** forbid `StructuredTaskScope` — preview on JDK 25 — and every other preview API. Preview-compiled class file stamped so it load only on exact JDK feature release it built on, making artifact version-locked.

*Off-the-shelf plus bespoke — preview code fail to compile without flag, so build fail closed; bespoke CI grep also scan compiler and launcher arguments across Maven and Gradle. **Not ArchUnit**, which read bytecode and cannot see compiler or launcher flags. Preview status and version-locked class file **confirmed** 2026-07-24; per-release API history behind it **uncertain**, nothing here rest on it.*

### Per-request context, and never a cached object in a `ThreadLocal`

**Put per-request context in `ThreadLocal` or, preferably, Scoped Value** (final in JDK 25) — **preferably for bounded lifetime and write-once binding, not for child-thread sharing.** Scoped Value binding inherited only by threads forked inside `StructuredTaskScope`, which preview ban above forbid, so **it never reach subtask here.** `InheritableThreadLocal` do reach one, but do not rely: platform not specify which thread construct child in per-task executor. Context that must reach subtask be established there by fan-out helper. **Never cache reusable object in `ThreadLocal`** — virtual threads never pooled, so per-thread cache just reallocate per task.

*Convention. Child-thread-sharing correction dated 2026-07-27, inheritance facts behind it **confirmed** 2026-07-27 by fan-out context panel; preference for Scoped Value on its other two properties be convention.*

### Keep the pinning event on, and alert on it

**Keep `jdk.VirtualThreadPinned` JFR event on** (default 20 ms threshold) **and alert on it in deployment.** Residual pinning on JDK 25 be native-only — native methods, foreign functions, blocking class initializers. Pinning not make application incorrect, but pinning that exhaust all carriers can stall scheduler, so treat sustained pinning as operability hazard not mere slowdown.

*Convention — monitoring wiring, 2026-07-24. **Tripwire, not guarantee**: many short sub-threshold pins can accumulate cost without ever firing. Residual pinning causes **confirmed** 2026-07-24.*

## Time

### `Clock` is injected

**Wall-clock reads in domain code banned** — `Instant.now()`, `LocalDate.now()`, `new Date()`, `System.currentTimeMillis()`.

*ArchUnit — off-the-shelf. **Convention**, 2026-07-21 — no external evidence survived, rule carry no citation. Kept because enforceable and cheap.*

### Business dates are their own concept

**Business date be `LocalDate` from explicit business-date source, never derived from wall clock. Timestamps be UTC `Instant`, stored as `timestamptz`.**

*Convention, 2026-07-21 — same standing as injected clock, no citation.*

**Future legal deadline be neither of these**, and `llm-default-traps` carry that rule — stored as local wall time plus governing zone, resolved at evaluation time, because zone rules change between now and deadline. Reading "timestamps are UTC" as covering deadline be specific mistake that rule exist to prevent.

## Null

### JSpecify, checked by NullAway, as compile errors

**JSpecify annotations, checked by NullAway running on Error Prone, as compile errors.** Nullness violation never reach review.

*Off-the-shelf. **Confirmed** mainstream, 2026-07-21 — Spring Boot 4 and Spring Framework 7 ship JSpecify-annotated null-safe APIs across portfolio, deprecate Spring own nullability annotations, check Spring own build with NullAway.*

## The runtime-silent ban list

**Behavior that never appear in program text be behavior implementer guess at.** Each entry below banned with named enforcing check.

*List as whole be **convention**, 2026-07-21 — defect-source claim carry no citation, no external evidence survived. Kept because enforceable, cheap, and every entry have named check. **Enforcement not confirmation**, and ArchUnit class below be enforcement.*

**Marker, date, check stated once here for whole list — one place in this skill they not inline per directive.** Deliberate, not dropped marker: entries below share single ground and single enforcement host, named in *Every ban names the check that enforces it* at end of list. Read each entry as carrying **convention, 2026-07-21** and that host.

**What this list not say be why constructor injection, route registration and typed config binding survive it**, since those be framework machinery too. Discriminator be **startup-loud versus runtime-silent** — mechanism whose failure be boot failure caught by first integration test, against one that change semantics silently at runtime — and it published in `ai-maintainer-principles`, not here. Repo carrying this list into own text without it will either ban own dependency injection or relax list informally until nothing banned.

### Field and setter injection

**Banned — constructor injection only.**

### `@Transactional`

**Banned.** Transactions be explicit visible blocks reached only through one transaction seam above; annotation-driven ambient transactions be thing being removed.

### `@Scheduled` and `@Async`

**Banned.** Scheduling and asynchronous work go through one explicit named mechanism. **On this stack that mechanism specified by `async-handoff` family**, which treat bare executor submit as asynchronous handoff with full rule set attached — including outbox requirement. This ban be half saying annotation not the mechanism; it not say what mechanism is.

### `@Cacheable`, `@CachePut`, `@CacheEvict`, `@Caching`, and AOP aspects on domain code

**Banned, together with any caching decorator wired behind domain interface.** This entry put them on list; **`caching` and `caching-java` skills be where ban get its checks, four grounds, and replacement**, not restated here because rule stated in two skills drift in one.

**What this stack add to those grounds be size of pull:** Spring cache abstraction be corpus default for "add caching" on this stack **by wide margin**, why it need ban with check not note. **Repo installing this skill and not `caching` have ban and no replacement** — no adapter seam, no staleness ceiling, no invalidation rule — so agent told only "annotation banned" hand-roll something worse. Install `caching` even if repo cache nothing today; first cached value be tripwire.

### Reflection-based dispatch and stringly-typed behavior lookups

**Banned.**

### Every ban names the check that enforces it

**Ban with no named check not on this list.** ArchUnit host ban on bytecode, Error Prone host one on source, and **which tool host which ban decided per rule by what each can read soundly** — not by preference. Worked case in `java-backend-observability`, where unloggable-domain-type rule must be Error Prone because ArchUnit see logger erased signature not argument static type; `caching-java` have two more of same shape. **Meta-test keep list honest:** each ban either enforced by named test or **explicitly marked deferred with reason**. **Reconcile both directions** — declared-enforced ban name test that actually exist, and test that enforce ban no stay undeclared. One direction alone let deferred ban be described as enforced *or* let wired rule drop off list, and both failure read as complete list. (Prior art, 2026-06-13, from same external record `guardrails-toolchain` convert its own material from; **that record not published in this skill set, and this clause restated in no other skill — this skill own it.** **Convention**, and both-direction clause not from 2026-07-21 pass.)

*ArchUnit on bytecode and Error Prone on source — off-the-shelf hosts; some predicates authored per repo.*

## Evidence toolchain

**Tests be the code review.** No rule in this skill assume human read generated code line by line.

### Integration tests run against real PostgreSQL

**Integration tests run against real PostgreSQL in throwaway container, applying real migrations. No in-memory substitute database.**

*Convention, 2026-07-21 — no external evidence survived, rule carry no citation. Kept because enforceable and cheap.*

### The ban list is an executable test class

**Ban list be ArchUnit test class — executable, not prose.**

*Off-the-shelf host; some predicates authored per repo. **Convention**, 2026-07-21 — trail make no confidence claim beyond noting ban-list test class plus meta-test **not independent confirmation** of bans it host.*

### Coverage is gated by JaCoCo

**Coverage gated by JaCoCo — `jacoco-maven-plugin` `check` goal — failing build below per-package `COVEREDRATIO` floor.** Coverage be floor under every package: **it prove line ran, not that test asserted on it**, so green floor necessary and never sufficient. Ratio and per-package split be adopting repo call, stated in repo. Pin JaCoCo to release supporting build Java version — it trail each Java release.

*Off-the-shelf host — ratio thresholds and per-package split authored per repo. Mechanics **confirmed**, verified 2026-07-25; no threshold numbers supplied here, deliberately, because floor tuned to one product risk profile not platform default.*

## Wiring the gates

**Run once per repo, in first pull request touching build.** These directives be two kinds welded together: instinct-overrides firing while agent write code, and build gates that must exist in repo. Instructing agent do nothing for second kind — **gate be what catch next agent**, and unwired gate be rule described as enforced that not.

1. **Ban-list ArchUnit test class**, with meta-test asserting every entry either enforced by named test or marked deferred with reason. Host for runtime-silent bans, WebFlux ban, attached-record and plain-SQL bans, `fetchOne` / `fetchAny` ban, no-injectable-`DSLContext` rule, wall-clock ban, raw-executor fan-out ban. **Generated jOOQ packages excluded** from all.
2. **Banned-dependency rules** for JPA, Hibernate, Spring Data JPA. Sibling skills add own entries to same config — logging backend pin in `java-backend-observability`, cache and broker client bans in `caching-java` and `async-handoff-java`, JVM dependency bans in `llm-default-traps`.
3. **jOOQ codegen-diff job** — regenerate from committed migrations against throwaway PostgreSQL container, fail on any git diff.
4. **Config-default assertions** for `spring.threads.virtual.enabled=true` and `Settings.withAttachRecords(false)`. Both read checked-in default, neither see runtime override.
5. **Error Prone on compile path**, with NullAway and JSpecify configured to fail compilation. Also host for any non-loggability check and for `fetchOne` / `fetchAny` ban if repo prefer source over bytecode — and **not** ArchUnit for first of those.
6. **squawk** over migrations in diff, gating on CLI exit code, with enabled rule set and per-migration opt-outs committed.
7. **Testcontainers integration-test setup** applying real migrations against real PostgreSQL.
8. **`jacoco-maven-plugin` `check` goal** with per-package `COVEREDRATIO` limits this repo state, version pinned to release supporting build JDK.
9. **CI grep for `--enable-preview`** across Maven and Gradle compiler and launcher arguments. Not ArchUnit, which cannot see them.
10. **`jdk.VirtualThreadPinned` JFR event and its alert**, in deployment not in build.

**Then record what was wired and what was skipped, with reason.** These be entries **nothing above gate**; each must be listed as ungated:

- **Never fanning out while holding connection** — spec and review. Not statically detectable by anything.
- **Pool sizing**, and ban on second semaphore over pool — pool-as-limiter principle be rule, no check read pool size against what PostgreSQL can serve.
- **Single-seam discipline for plain SQL** — ban gated; that exempted seams be few, named, test-pinned not.
- **That transaction seam own connection acquisition** — ArchUnit ban injecting `DSLContext`, not every path to `Connection`.
- **Business-date and `ThreadLocal`-caching rules**, and Jackson and Flyway picks — convention, no check.
- **Whether `PlainSQLChecker` wired**, if repo chose it over ArchUnit path. Compatibility with pinned JDK and Error Prone unverified here, must be established by adopting repo.

**Record listing only what was wired read as complete coverage.** That be failure this step exist to prevent.

## Named gaps — where no check reaches

Silence read as coverage, so each stated.

1. **Config-default assertion not runtime assertion.** Both — virtual-threads property and attached-records setting — read checked-in default. Env variable or external config source can override either in deployed process, and **no gate here notice.** Same limitation apply to structured-logging property in `java-backend-observability`.
2. **Fan-out-while-holding-a-connection rule have no possible gate.** One rule here stated as undetectable, not merely ungated.
3. **Generated jOOQ packages excluded from every ArchUnit ban.** Rule written into generated package unreached by design. Correct — generator output not hand-written code — but exclusion boundary be load-bearing, and hand-written class placed in generated package escape whole ban list.
4. **`--enable-preview` grep cover what grep cover.** Compile failure be real gate and fail closed; grep exist for case where flag added deliberately, and be bespoke text-matching over build files, not analysis.
5. **Coverage floor cannot see whether test asserted anything.** Mutation testing, which can, **deliberately scoped to money packages only** by `money-java` skill. So package in general tier can sit green at floor over vacuous machine-written tests, and **nothing in this skill detect that.** Extending mutation testing beyond money be decision with named trigger, not oversight — general-tier defect traced to vacuous tests, or diff-scoped mutation testing becoming affordable.
6. **Three Platform directives rest on no evidence note.** WebFlux ban, Flyway rule, Jackson pick. Dates inferred from pass scope; reader treating them as researched to same standard as jOOQ claims read more than is there.
7. **Plain-SQL checker wireability unverified.** ArchUnit path work and be what ship; stronger compile-error path named as stronger without being tried against this stack pinned versions.
8. **Pinning alert be threshold tripwire.** Accumulated short pins below threshold cost real scheduler time and fire nothing.
9. **Codegen-diff gate assume generation reproducible, and nothing assert it.** Job regenerate once and diff. Non-determinism in generator — iteration order, locale-dependent sorting, embedded timestamp — make gate flap, and flapping gate get relaxed, at which point it mask drift it exist to catch. `java-backend-api` carry stronger form for its document: regenerate **twice** under varied timezone and locale in one pinned container, byte-identical to both. Not carried here — stated 2026-08-01 when `guardrails-toolchain` published general form, cuz asserting it never verified against jOOQ generator on this stack.
10. **No rule here say anything about primary keys, and migration lint above no ask.** This skill require schema change be committed Flyway migration and be linted for lock and rewrite hazard; **nothing say what the key column be, how it be generated, or what may be assumed about its order.** Agent writing first migration on this stack therefore reach for its corpus default — `bigserial` or `gen_random_uuid()` — and neither squawk nor any ArchUnit ban here notice. **Published since 2026-08-01 in `primary-keys`**, whose gates are a migration grep, a table-classification job and an `ORDER BY`-on-id ban this skill's ban-list test class can host. Gap stated rather than closed here, cuz that skill be stack-neutral and this one carry no key rule of its own to narrow.

## Markers, dates, and what they mean

Confidence, per claim: **confirmed** mean claim survived three independent refutation votes against primary sources on date it state. **Primary-source verified** mean one researcher checked against primary source with **no panel** — not confirmed whatever its evidentiary strength, and running panel be what promote it. **Convention** mean research did not, or could not, confirm claim from independent sources; rule kept because enforceable, cheap, fail toward safety. **Uncertain** mean claim examined and left unsettled; nothing here allowed to rest on one.

Enforcement, per rule: **off-the-shelf** mean tool do it with configuration; **bespoke** mean check must be written; **convention** mean human or agent asserting it be all there is.

**Lapse rule:** past `review-by` **2027-01-21**, every *confirmed* marker in this skill read as *convention* until new pass re-date it, no maintainer action needed. That be why date sit beside every claim.
